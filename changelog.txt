v1.1 (prototypev1)

+ Changed get_wire_info to get_wireframe
+ get_wire_info now takes vertices and faces as the inputs
+ delaunay first impl
+ original impl still available with get_wire_info_prototype
- removed some redundant commenting (code cleanup)

This doesn't work very well (the delaunay function needs work or needs a better point cloud of surface)

surface_triangulation

used in build pymesh functions to create a more refined surface mesh of the bulbasaur.

By splitting long edges and collapsing short edges we achieve a more consistent pattern on the surface of the shape
